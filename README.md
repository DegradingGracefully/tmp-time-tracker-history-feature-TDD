# tmp-time-tracker-history-feature-TDD

:warning: This is just a temporary repo that I had to publish in order to share some code ;) 

It contains the source code backing the  :construction: draft [An experiment with applying TDD to Front development](https://dev.to/degradinggracefully/hands-on-tdd-for-front-development-1625-temp-slug-2602786?preview=03b4498d22f50b4b0eeb6954850cc135dc89559bc46eb8603d12ad9c25792f3e8325d19dbf153e25f543cad3ec6367701475dab83704e48ddb507fc3) .

Initial commit: the final result is a Cypress test suite and the Svelte UI built with the help of these tests.

```shell
npm install
```

## Run the app

###### Run Svelte:
